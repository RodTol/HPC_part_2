slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 10393428 ON r208n03 CANCELLED AT 2023-06-24T12:11:40 ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[57280,0],0] on node r208n03
  Remote daemon: [[57280,0],7] on node r243n15

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
